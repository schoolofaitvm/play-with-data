# Introduction to Google Colab

Machine Learning is a computationally expensive task. And Google has extended their helping hand with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). They provide us with systems equipped with Xeon processors and Nvidia K80 GPU's to accelerate our code 10x faster.

Google colab is a modified Ipython notebook, i.e the format in which the tutorial contents are laid out. 
To get started.

1. Go to the Google Colab site.
2. Select \>File\>Upload.
3. Upload the notebook that you want to run.
4. Enjoy!

A few short cuts on how to use an Ipython notebook and Colab notebook. You can document as well as code on a notebook. Coding can be done in a kind of a html type of markup language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). You can find the syntax and a cheet sheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

- You insert a new text/code cell with the +(code/text) icon on the top left of the controls.
- You run a cell using Ctrl+Enter.
- You can run linux shell commands using the '!' tag. eg (!ls to display the files)
- However, you cannot change directories like that. Figuring out is up to you and google will show you the way! ;)
- To upload a file from your pc, you will have to use Google Colab python API. You can find a detailed description and usage [here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb).
